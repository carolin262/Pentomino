Pentomino is in this case a two player board game, invented by Solomon Wolf Golomb. 
It has a 12*12 board and 12 stones, which are all possible ways to put 5 squares (2d) next to each other.

In the begining those two players have to choose their stones, this happends alternating. 
Afterwards those stones have to be placed on the board. Whereby it's alternating and once again, it's a 
2d game, those stones have to lay on the board.

The first player, who isn't able to place one more stone on the board loses.
A draw is actually possible while all 12 stones are placed.
